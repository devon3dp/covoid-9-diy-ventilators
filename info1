Also I shared the image with my engineer and doctor friend
How to control the following parameters in this design : 
1. No. Of breaths per minute. 
2. Vary flow rate of air in and out. 
3. Can either volume or pressure of the pumped air be regulated? 
4. What about sensors that provide real time visual feedback regarding the volume, pressure, O2 content, 
CO2 content in exhaling, etc. Can they be incorporated?
5. For which type of ventilation is this design made for? Invasive or non invasive? 
Also....more specifically, which mode of mechanical ventilation? CPAP, BiPAP, AC,PC, PEEP?
6. How safe is the design? You have mentioned that the bag will burst if a 1/2" valve is used instead of a 1/4". 
So can this design be used for continuous prolonged use?
i'm awaiting an email from Head of NHS innovation (good friends with him) to give 
me all the variables a hospital would need to see on the lcd screen
